mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, four times the value in ECX, and 0x10.  The potential bug lies in the lack of bounds checking.  If either EBX, ECX, or their calculated sum exceeds valid memory limits, this could lead to a segmentation fault or other memory access violation.
